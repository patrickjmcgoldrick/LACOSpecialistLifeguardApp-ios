# Purpose
Telestaff as a terrible web interface.  The mobile web interface is even more crippled than the desktop version.

This app's features:
* Roster organized by Area (Date may be chosen, defaults to today)
* Color coding by job title 
* Colors may be adjusted in Settings
* Vacancies displayed, if activated in Settings
* Recall list (Date may be chosen, defaults to today)
* Data reloads may be requested with the refresh button
